**Historical Note** Earlier versions were published before `v1.0.0` but the code was then a branch inside [`leveldown`](https://github.com/level/leveldown). This version marks the point where that code was extracted into its own repository thanks to the work of [`@mcollina`](https://github.com/mcollina).
