## Introduction

This module closely follows [`leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/leveldown) and implements the same API. The difference is that `leveldown` is a binding for [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) while `rocksdb` is a binding for [RocksDB, Facebook's fork of LevelDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb).

It is **strongly recommended** that you use `levelup` in preference to `rocksdb` unless you have measurable performance reasons to do so. `levelup` is optimized for usability and safety. Although we are working to improve the safety of the `rocksdb` interface it is still easy to crash your Node process if you don't do things in just the right way.

**If you are upgrading:** please see [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).

## Supported Platforms

We aim to support _at least_ Active LTS and Current Node.js releases, Electron 4.0.0, as well as any future Node.js and Electron releases thanks to [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html). Because N-API has an experimental status in node 6 and early 8.x releases, the minimum node version for `rocksdb` is `8.6.0`.

The `rocksdb` npm package ships with prebuilt binaries for popular 64-bit platforms and is known to work on:

- **Linux** (including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi and Kindle)
- **Mac OS**
- **Solaris** (SmartOS & Nodejitsu)
- **FreeBSD**
- **Windows**

When installing `rocksdb`, [`node-gyp-build`](https://github.com/prebuild/node-gyp-build) will check if a compatible binary exists and fallback to a compile step if it doesn't. In that case you'll need a [valid `node-gyp` installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

If you don't want to use the prebuilt binary for the platform you are installing on, specify the `--build-from-source` flag when you install. If you are working on `rocksdb` itself and want to re-compile the C++ code it's enough to do `npm install`.

## API

Please refer to [`leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/leveldown#api) for API documentation. The `db.open(options, callback)` method of `rocksdb` has a few additional options:

- `readOnly` (boolean, default `false`): open database in read-only mode.
- `infoLogLevel` (string, default `null`): verbosity of info log. One of `'debug'`, `'info'`, `'warn'`, `'error'`, `'fatal'`, `'header'` or `null` (disable).

### Publishing

1. Increment the version: `npm version ..`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push --follow-tags`
3. Wait for Travis and AppVeyor builds to complete
4. Download prebuilds into `./prebuilds`: `npm run download-prebuilds`
5. Optionally verify loading a prebuild: `npm run test-prebuild`
6. Optionally verify which files npm will include: `canadian-pub`
7. Add changelog to the GitHub release
8. Finally: `npm publish`
